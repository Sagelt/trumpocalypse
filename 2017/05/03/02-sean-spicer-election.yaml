quote: Spicer ostensibly meant the remark as a jab at the media and at Hillary Clinton, who discussed her loss in an interview with CNN on Tuesday. What he failed to take into consideration is the fact that Trump has spent 68 of the 176 days since he won the presidential election talking about the fact that he won the presidential election.
