quote: "The bill would make deep and sweeping changes to the American health care system. Broadly, the bill loosens Obamacareâ€™s rules on what insurance companies must offer in their plans, opening the door for plans that are cheaper but offer weaker coverage. Most controversially, the American Health Care Act allows insurance companies to charge people with pre-existing conditions higher premiums than healthy people in states that request waivers to do so. The bill passed narrowly, 217-213, Thursday afternoon and now goes to the Senate, where 51 members will need to pass it before Donald Trump can sign the bill into law. Many provisions, such as stripping federal funding for Planned Parenthood, will become major battles when the Senate gets its hands on the bill. Further changes are all but guaranteed."
