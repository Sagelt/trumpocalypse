quote: "“I shouldn't say this to our great gentleman and my friend from Australia, because you have better health care than we do,” Trump continued. “We're going to have great health care very soon.” Trump's high opinion of Australian health care is not shared by his Republican colleagues. Australia offers universal health care to its citizens, which is funded by taxes."
