quote: "“The time has expired for 'reform,'” Devos said. “We need a transformation – a transformation that will open up America's closed and antiquated education system. If we really want to help students, then we need to focus everything about education on individual students – funding, supporting and investing in them. Not in buildings; not in systems. It shouldn't matter where a student learns so long as they are actually learning.”"
