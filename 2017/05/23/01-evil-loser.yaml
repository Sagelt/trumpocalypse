quote: “So many young, beautiful, innocent people living and enjoying their lives murdered by evil losers in life,” Trump said of the explosion that targeted an adolescent audience. “I won’t call them monsters, because they would like that term. They would think that’s a great name. I will call them, from now on, losers. They’re losers. And we’ll have more of them. But they’re losers. Just remember that.”
