quote: "In substance, Trump’s decree against terrorism did not differ greatly from President Barack Obama’s first big speech on Islam, which he delivered in Cairo in 2009, where he also called for peace in the Middle East. The starkest difference was in optics: Obama spoke in front of a crowd of activists, students and government officials, while the visual of Trump was a man seated next to the king of Saudi Arabia."
