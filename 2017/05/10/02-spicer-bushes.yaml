quote: Naturally, the media followed. And after the TV segments were done, Spicer literally hid with his staff behind a tall hedge trying to decide what to do. (Oh, to have been a spider in that hedge.) “After Spicer spent several minutes hidden in the bushes behind these sets,” as a major American newspaper writes of a senior White House official, he emerged, told reporters to turn their lights and cameras off, and answered questions in the dark, between two bushes, for about 10 minutes.
