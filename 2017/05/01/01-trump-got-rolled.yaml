quote: "1. There are explicit restrictions to block the border wall. 2. Non-defense domestic spending will go up, despite the Trump team’s insistence he wouldn’t let that happen. 3. Barack Obama’s cancer moonshot is generously funded. 4. Trump fought to cut the Environmental Protection Agency by a third. The final deal trims its budget by just 1 percent, with no staff cuts. 5. He didn’t defund Planned Parenthood. 6. The president got less than half as much for the military as he said was necessary. 7. Democrats say they forced Republicans to withdraw more than 160 riders. 8. To keep negotiations moving, the White House already agreed last week to continue paying Obamacare subsidies."
