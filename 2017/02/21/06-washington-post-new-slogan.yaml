quote: The same day that President Trump called out the media as an “enemy of the American people,” one of the nation’s oldest and most important newspapers retaliated against the president’s continual unhinged bashing of the press. The Washington Post has changed its slogan to “Democracy dies in darkness,” which is both powerful and alliterative.
