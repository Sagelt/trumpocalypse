quote: 'Not everyone is thrilled with the new Winter White House, however. Sen. Tom Udall, D-New Mexico, in a letter sent Friday to the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General, took issue with the arrangements Trump has made to separate his private assets from his public life. "While he may have a residence at Mar-a-Lago, it remains a for-profit business and allows members access to the club while the President is there," Udall wrote.'
