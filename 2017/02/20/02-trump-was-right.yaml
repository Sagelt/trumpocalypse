quote: "The world reacted with confusion after Donald Trump cited a Swedish terrorist attack during a campaign-style rally in Florida that appeared never to have happened. One of the country's official Twitter accounts, controlled by a different citizen each week, said: “Nothing has happened here in Sweden. There has not [been] any terrorist attacks here. At all.” However, despite widespread debunking of his claims, it has since emerged a largely underreported attack did, in fact, occur last month. Three suspected neo-Nazis were arrested in January after a Gothenburg Asylum centre became the target of a homemade bomb attack, leaving one person seriously injured."
