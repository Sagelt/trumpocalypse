quote: "The guidance states that analysts should only include facts that support their analyses, and it explains that topics presented in the PDB will not be covered from different perspectives in separate briefings. That means that dissenting or conflicting views might not be presented to Trump. Obama's PDB did include dissenting information, when appropriate, according to a former top CIA official with direct knowledge of the PDB."
