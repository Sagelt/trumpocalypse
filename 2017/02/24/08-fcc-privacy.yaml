quote: New FCC Chairman Ajit Pai is gearing up for a full-scale assault on former chairman Tom Wheeler’s privacy rules. Passed in October, the privacy rules require internet service providers to get explicit permission before sharing users’ browsing history, location, and other sensitive data. Pai voted against the privacy rules at the time, and today, he announced a new plan that could see the rules frozen in as little as a week’s time.
