quote: "“We're getting really bad dudes out of this country, and at a rate that nobody's ever seen before,” Trump said Thursday. “And they're the bad ones. And it's a military operation.” He added: “You see what's happening at the border. All of a sudden for the first time, we're getting gang members out. We're getting drug lords out.” A White House spokesperson said Trump did not misspeak by calling deportations a 'military operation,' but clarified the President meant “military” as an “adjective.” “The President was clearly describing the orderly and professional manner in which his executive orders are being implemented, and the administration's emphasis on removing serious criminals here in the US illegally,” the spokesperson said.
