quote: "Seattle-area cloud company Sysgain on Tuesday was reportedly the subject of an immigration raid — something the official allegedly called a “routine inspection.” The immigration official who was at the scene at the company's Redmond office allegedly made everyone put their cell phones away, demanded records and documentation, and questioned why some of the cubicles were empty, according to a Facebook post from someone familiar with the matter."
