desc: “Duffy’s comments overlook the fact that a person in America is seven times more likely to be killed by a right-wing extremist than a Muslim attacker. In Duffy’s home state of Wisconsin in August 2012, a white supremacist killed six during a mass shooting in at a Sikh temple in Oak Creek. But Duffy didn’t mention that. He also ignored the role Trump’s Islamophobic rhetoric played in a proliferation of hate incidents across the country since the election.”
