title: "Donald Trump: Republican members of Congress only represent “Republican people” in their districts"

quote: Trump’s purpose, presumably, was to hint (as other Republicans have asserted) that the protesters currently filling up town halls of Republican members of Congress to urge them to keep the Affordable Care Act don’t actually live in those members’ districts; that they’re bused in and possibly paid. But that’s not what he said. He said that “they’re not the Republican people that our representatives are representing.” He said that Republican members of Congress aren’t elected to represent the people who live in their districts, or even the citizens of their districts — they’re elected to represent the people who voted for them, and free to ignore everybody else.
