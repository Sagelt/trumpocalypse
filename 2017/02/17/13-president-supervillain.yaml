quote: It’s low-effort, high-yield stuff. An easy joke, maybe, but having the Red Skull preparing to toss a giant comic book bomb at Captain America while insisting, “I’m really not a bad person, by the way!” is no less delightful for it. As it is, it would take a minimal amount of effort to retcon the Red Skull’s origin story as his scarred and cratered visage having been brought about as the consequence of overzealous spray-tanning.
