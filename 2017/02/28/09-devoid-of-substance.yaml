title: Trump’s speech to Congress was mostly devoid of substance

quote: Aside from that, the speech had little to commend in it. The substitute for gloom and doom turned out to be sophomoric pabulum like: “We just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts.” Entirely devoid of substance, the fortune-cookie-like admonitions sounded like time fillers to extend the speech to an acceptable length. (“From now on, America will be empowered by our aspirations, not burdened by our fears.”) With too many clunkers like “Think of the marvels we can achieve if we simply set free the dreams of our people,” it’s evident he really needs a presidential-caliber speechwriter.
