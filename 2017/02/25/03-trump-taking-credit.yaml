quote: "To start, Trump hasn't passed any orders pertaining to the budget since he took office. As economist Dan Mitchell explained, “Considering that Trump hasn’t enacted any fiscal legislation, it’s a bit of a stretch for him to take credit for any changes in debt levels.” Mitchell also added that the debt levels tend to fluctuate in a short-term time period."
