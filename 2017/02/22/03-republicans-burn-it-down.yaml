quote: The Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act is not going well, in large part because it turns out that making sweeping changes to a system that encompasses one-sixth of the American economy turns out to be rather more complicated than they imagined. Their backtracking has an interesting character to it, in particular how theyâ€™ve been gobsmacked by the transition from shaking their fists at the system to being responsible for it.
