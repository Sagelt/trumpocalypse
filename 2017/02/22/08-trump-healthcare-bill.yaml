quote: In a normal organization — the kind where a leader can be left unaccompanied for a few hours without his subordinates fearing he will descend into a television-binge-fueled social-media meltdown — it could be assumed that the highest-ranking official’s word would override that of his appointed department leader. Given that it’s Trump, basically everybody would assume that Price is the one who knows what he’s talking about and the president is making things up.
