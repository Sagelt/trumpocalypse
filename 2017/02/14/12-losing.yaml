quote: "Remember when Donald Trump promised to be the Harlem Globetrotters of politics? “We're gonna win at everything we do!” said Trump. “We're gonna win, win, win. You people, you're gonna be sick and tired of winning.” Now he's president of the United States, and Trump has indeed given us tricks and deceptions worthy of the basketball legends. But winning? Not so much."
