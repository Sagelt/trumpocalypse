quote: "In this era of fake news, such bold claims should not be left unverified. As our investigation shows, both Donald Trump and Linda McMahon, as shown in figures one and four, would not count as a fully executed Stone Cold Stunner. If both were to receive half credit, the figure drops to 38.5 percent. We rate Mr. McQuadeâ€™s claim: False."
