quote: Given how quick Trump is to denounce many things, and how much of the new American anti-Semitism comes from his supporters, his one denunciation doesn’t count as permanent. If the anti-Semitism continues, so must the president’s rejection of it. He, more than anyone else, has the responsibility to make everyday religious bigotry again feel like a part of the country’s past.
