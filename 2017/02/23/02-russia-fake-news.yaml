quote: The web page, unveiled Wednesday, includes links to five English-language news stories about Russia, including articles from Bloomberg, NBC, and The New York Times. The site includes screenshots of the articles with a red “FAKE” stamp on each one. A caption under each screenshot simply claims that the article in question “does not correspond to reality,” without providing any further evidence.
