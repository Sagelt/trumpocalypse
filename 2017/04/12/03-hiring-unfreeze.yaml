quote: Cautioning “this does not mean agencies will be free to hire willy-nilly,” Mulvaney said the across-the-board hiring freeze the president imposed by executive order three days after taking office in January is being replaced with a “smarter plan, a more strategic plan, a more surgical plan.”
desc: For context, this is Trump rolling back his own executive order just 80 days after putting it in to effect.
