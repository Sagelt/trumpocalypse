quote: But experts say ballistic missiles tests the North launched in recent months timed to meetings between President Donald Trump and the leaders of China and Japan, along with its propensity for grandiose promises of war, follow “seasonal” patterns. [...] This time, however, the Trump administration has shifted tack, threatening to upend years of diplomatic policy against the North that are often centered around economic sanctions and a hope that the hermit country’s prime ally, China, will keep its neighbor in check.
desc: The key take away appears to be that North Korea's actions here are rather typical, the kind of things Trump should be prepared for. This year this typical event is starting to spiral out of control, and the difference is Trump. A level-headed leader can respond to North Korea's provocations reasonably, but Trump seems determined to trade rhetoric for rhetoric until he runs out of rhetoric and gets everyone killed.
