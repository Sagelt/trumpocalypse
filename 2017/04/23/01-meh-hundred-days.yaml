quote: "Trump, in short, is having a crisis of confidence. And that's why turning to himself when assigning blame for these first 100 days may be so crucial for him to regain his footing. A dose of humility could go a long way, perhaps, if he addressed Americans like this: “Hey guys, I know we've failed to get Obamacare repealed and that my travel ban is stuck in the courts again. But I'm new to this. Give me another 100 days.”"
