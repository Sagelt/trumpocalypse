quote: "Though the Loops' home is on US territory, it is located on the other side of the country's border fence. The family was essentially locked out of its own country when the fence was built a decade ago. That's because construction of a border barrier is complicated by concerns over the environment, geography, topography and other matters. It doesn't always follow the true border between Mexico and the US."
