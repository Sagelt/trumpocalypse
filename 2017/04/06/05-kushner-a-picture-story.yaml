quote: This is Jared. Jared’s never been to war before. But his father-in-law, a very busy man, sent Jared to the war to see how it’s going!
desc: "Are we sure Kushner isn't actually a Bluth? He looks like GOB and I could imagine him saying “These are my awards, Father. From Army. The seal is for marksmanship, and the gorilla is for sand racing. Now if you'll excuse me, they're putting me in something called Hero Squad.”"
