title: ACLU Complaint on Travel Ban
url: https://www.aclu.org/sites/default/files/field_document/1-_complaint.pdf
desc: 'Because the executive order is unlawful as applied to Petitioners, their continued detention based solely on the executive order violates their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights, and is ultra vires the immigration statutes. Further, Petitionersâ€™ continued unlawful detention is part of a widespread pattern applied to many refugees and arriving aliens detained after the issuance of the January 27, 2017 executive order. Therefore, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, Petitioners respectfully apply to this Court for a writ of habeas corpus to remedy their unlawful detention by Respondents, and for declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent such harms from recurring.'
