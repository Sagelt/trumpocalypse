desc: “What Trump did, however, in a spectacularly dumb and uniquely cruel move, was to say that his administration would not recognize visas, or permanent residencies that were already issued to people from the blacklisted countries. He decided they simply wouldn’t be allowed in. He also decided it was effective immediately, even for people in midair who had boarded planes with valid visas.”
