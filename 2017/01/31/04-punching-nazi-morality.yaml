desc: “For many, there’s solidarity, as people laugh at the awful racist’s discomfort. For too many, Nazism is viewed as merely another opinion – not an inherent threat – so a punched Nazi is something small to celebrate. In response, others have equated punching a Nazi with Nazism. “You are just as bad as they are!” is the claim. This is when “We’re better than this!” is a cover for “This upsets me!”.”
