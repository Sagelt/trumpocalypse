quote: "But all of this doesn't sit well with government watchdogs, who are urging President Donald Trump to officially hire his daughter. They wrote a letter to White House counsel Don McGahn Friday that claims Ivanka Trump's position "creates a middle space that does not exist,” The Associated Press reported. The letter signed by two former White House lawyers states: “On the one hand, her position will provide her with the privileges and opportunities for service that attach to being a White House employee. On the other hand, she remains the owner of a private business who is free from the ethics and conflicts rules that apply to all White House employees.”"
