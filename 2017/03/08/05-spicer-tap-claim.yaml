quote: "That claim, which has been propagating in conservative media for several days, was shot down by none other than Rosen himself during a recent appearance on Fox News. “I was not wiretapped, my parents were not wiretapped, which is where you place a listening device on someone's telephone line and you listen to their conversations,” Rosen told Fox & Friends on Sunday after the show's hosts claimed his phones were tapped."
