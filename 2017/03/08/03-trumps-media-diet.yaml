quote: "And I should have seen it all coming. During my weeks on the Trump media diet, I surfed an endless feedback loop circulating between Trump and his preferred media outlets, where speculation leads to justification, ad infinitum. Through this fish-eye, Trump’s wiretapping tweets don’t look surprising at all. They would instead represent the logical conclusion of what happens when the President of the United States seems to believe everything he hears—and when he limits what he hears to what he wants to hear."
