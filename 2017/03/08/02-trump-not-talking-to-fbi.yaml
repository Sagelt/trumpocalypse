quote: "Mr Trump on Saturday accused Barack Obama of ordering surveillance at Trump Tower in New York during the election, but has offered no evidence. FBI Director James Comey has reportedly rejected the allegation - one report said he was “incredulous”. But White House spokesman Sean Spicer said on Tuesday the president has yet to speak to him about it."
