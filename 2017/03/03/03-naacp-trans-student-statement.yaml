quote: "The proposition that G.G. should go back to using the “separate restroom” parrots the functionalist logic that this Court discarded along with “separate but equal.” The Trump Administration’s recent withdrawal of the guidance on transgender students and its description of bathroom access as a “states’ rights issue” only amplifies the disconcerting historical echoes in this case. State and local officials often invoked “states’ rights” as a basis for opposing this Court’s decisions and insulating prohibited discrimination from statutory and constitutional review. Indeed “states’ rights” was the frequent refrain of officials who fought against racial integration, including in bathrooms. Ultimately, however, the claim of “states’ rights” has no relevance to this Court’s interpretation of a federal statute—in this case Title IX—as states are bound by this Court’s interpretation of federal law."
