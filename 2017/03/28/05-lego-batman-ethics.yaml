quote: Senate Finance ranking member Ron Wyden is asking the top U.S. ethics officer to examine whether Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin violated his ethics agreement by talking up a movie he helped finance. “I’m not allowed to promote anything I’m involved in,” Mnuchin said at a Friday event hosted by Axios. “So I just want to have the legal disclosure; you’ve asked me the question, and I am not promoting any product. But you should send all your kids to ‘Lego Batman.’”
desc: I’ll admit, I’m posting this in part just so I can have a Batman tag.
