quote: One cannot simply dismiss these tweets as the rantings of a thin-skinned, angry old man. To feel sympathy to Trump, you’d have to ignore the ways that American wiretaps work. You’d have to be unconcerned about the underlying issues that led the government to seek a wiretap in the first place. And you’d have to be willing to suspend your sense of patriotism and see everything through a partisan lens.
